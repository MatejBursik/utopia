The game is a text based game. You move and interact with objects

- ~player.moveX(3)~: moves the player right by 3 blocks.
- ~player.moveY(-1)~: moves the player down by 1 block.
- ~chest.interact()~: if the player is exactly on top of a chest, this command opens
  the chest and takes the coins inside the chest.
- ~door.interact()~: if the player is hovering over the exit, this command opens
  the door and ends the level.
What to look for:
- Chests look like this:
